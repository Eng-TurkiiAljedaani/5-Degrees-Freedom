# Robotic Arm 3D Model

This project features a 3D model of a robotic arm, designed using Tinkercad. The model simulates the structure of an articulated robotic arm, commonly found in industrial automation and robotic applications. It consists of multiple joints and links that mimic a real-world robotic manipulator.
